# Writing Closure

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j

# Write the Python procedure, closure, that takes five parameters:

#   grammar: the grammar using the previously described structure
#   i: a number representing the chart state that we are currently looking at
#   x: a single nonterminal
#   ab and cd: lists of many things

# The closure function should return all the new parsing states that we want to
# add to chart position i

# Hint: This is tricky. If you are stuck, do a list comphrension over the grammar rules.

def closure (grammar, i, x, ab, cd):
    return [ (g[0], [], g[1], i) for g in grammar
             if cd != [] and g[0] == cd[0]]

grammar = [
    ("exp", ["exp", "+", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["exp", "-", "exp"]),
    ("exp", ["(", "exp", ")"]),
    ("exp", ["num"]),
    ("t",["I","like","t"]),
    ("t",[""])
]

print closure(grammar,0,"exp",["exp","+"],["exp"]) == [('exp', [], ['exp', '+', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['exp', '-', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['(', 'exp', ')'], 0), ('exp', [], ['num'], 0)]
print closure(grammar,0,"exp",[],["exp","+","exp"]) == [('exp', [], ['exp', '+', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['exp', '-', 'exp'], 0), ('exp', [], ['(', 'exp', ')'], 0), ('exp', [], ['num'], 0)]

# Writing Shift

# We are currently looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j. The input is tokens.

# Your procedure, shift, should either return None, at which point there is
# nothing to do or will return a single new parsing state that presumably
# involved shifting over the c if c matches the ith token.

def shift (tokens, i, x, ab, cd, j):
    nextstate = None
    if cd != [] and tokens[i] == cd[0]:
        nextstate = (x, ab + [cd[0]], cd[1:], j)
    return nextstate

print shift(["exp","+","exp"],2,"exp",["exp","+"],["exp"],0) == ('exp', ['exp', '+', 'exp'], [], 0)
print shift(["exp","+","exp"],0,"exp",[],["exp","+","exp"],0) == ('exp', ['exp'], ['+', 'exp'], 0)
print shift(["exp","+","exp"],3,"exp",["exp","+","exp"],[],0) == None
print shift(["exp","+","ANDY LOVES COOKIES"],2,"exp",["exp","+"],["exp"],0) == None


# Writing Reductions

# We are looking at chart[i] and we see x => ab . cd from j.

# Hint: Reductions are tricky, so as a hint, remember that you only want to do
# reductions if cd == []

# Hint: You'll have to look back previously in the chart.

def reductions(chart, i, x, ab, cd, j):
    if cd == []:
        return [ (s[0], s[1] + [s[2][0]], s[2][1:], s[3]) for s in chart[j]
                   if s[2] != [] and x == s[2][0] ]
    else:
        return None
