# Javascript interpreter in python
This project implements a javascript (a subset of language feature) interpreter in python. Most of the ideas are inspired by [Udacity CS262](https://www.udacity.com/courses/cs262). Refer [jsinterpreter.py](https://github.com/zhongweiy/jsinterpreter/blob/master/jsinterpreter.py) to how to use it.
